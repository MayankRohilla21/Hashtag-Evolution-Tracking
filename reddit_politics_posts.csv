Megathread: GOP Blocks Bipartisan Probe of Deadly Jan. 6 Riot at Capitol,"Senate Republicans on Friday blocked creation of a bipartisan panel to study the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, turning aside the independent investigation in a show of party loyalty to former President Donald Trump and an effort to shift the political focus away from the violent insurrection by his GOP supporters.

The Senate vote was 54-35 — short of the 60 votes needed to take up a House-passed bill that would have formed a 10-member commission evenly split between the two parties. It came a day after emotional appeals from police who fought with the rioters and lawmakers who fled Capitol chambers that day.

Six Republicans (Portman, Sasse, Cassidy, Collins, Murkowski, Romney) voted with Democrats to move forward. Eleven senators missed the rare Friday vote.
